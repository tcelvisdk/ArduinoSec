/*
* Randall Schmidt
* A task scheduler that keeps an array of tasks
* and uses timer interrupts at regular intervals
* to execute those tasks at approximately the time
* specified by the caller. In this implementation
* the caller must know an upper limit for how many
* tasks will be scheduled at once. This kind of
* scheme works best with a small maximum number of
* scheduled tasks and a low time resolution.
* Otherwise you may be using more clock cycles
* than you'd like.
